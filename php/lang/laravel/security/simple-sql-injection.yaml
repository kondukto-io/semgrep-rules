  message: |
    Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs,
    the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead 
    of ordinary user data. This can be used to alter query logic to bypass security checks,
    or to insert additional statements that modify the back-end database, possibly
    including execution of system commands.
