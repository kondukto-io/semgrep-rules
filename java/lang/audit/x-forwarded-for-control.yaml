  message: |
    The X-Forwarded-For (XFF) HTTP header field is a common method for identifying the originating
    IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or load balancer. Since this header 
    is not set by server and can be easily spoofed by the client It may cause injection attacks if `$ADDR`
    is not filtered for properly.
